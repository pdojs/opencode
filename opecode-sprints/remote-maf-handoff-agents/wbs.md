# Remote MAF Handoff Agents in OpenCode — WBS

## WBS0 — write planning artifacts to opecode-sprints (this step)

**Goal**: The plan exists as versioned files in `/Users/pdops/projects/opencode/opecode-sprints/remote-maf-handoff-agents/` before any implementation work starts.

**Steps**:
1. Create `requirements.md`, `design-proposal.md`, `wbs.md` in this folder. (done)
2. Commit in the `opencode` repo (this folder lives inside its working tree): `docs: add remote MAF handoff agents plan`.

This is a documentation-only step with no source-code change surface in `opencode` or `agent-framework`.

## Dependency graph

```
WS1 (maf-container-server)     — independent (Python/container side)
WS2 (remote-location-runner)   — depends on WS1's wire protocol (manifest + chat WS shape)
WS3 (remote-tool-bridge)       — depends on WS2 (needs the runner/session plumbing in place)
WS4 (agent-picker-ui)          — depends on WS2 (needs a runner to bind to), can start once WS2's client interface is stubbed
WS5 (compose-dev-env)          — depends on WS1, WS2, WS3 (end-to-end wiring to demo)
```

Parallelism: WS1 can start immediately and fully independently. WS2 can start once WS1's manifest/chat WS message shapes are drafted (does not need WS1 fully implemented, just the contract). WS4 can be stubbed against a fake client in parallel with WS2/WS3. WS5 is last — integration/demo only.

## Branch names

Flat, hyphenated, off `dev`, per repo convention (no `feature/`/`dev/` slash prefixes):

- `maf-container-server` (WS1, in `agent-framework` repo)
- `remote-location-runner` (WS2, in `opencode` repo)
- `remote-tool-bridge` (WS3, in `opencode` repo)
- `agent-picker-ui` (WS4, in `opencode` repo)
- `compose-dev-env` (WS5, sprints-folder only, no product-repo branch needed)

## Recommended implementation order

1. WS1 (maf-container-server) — no dependencies, unblocks everything else's contract.
2. WS2 (remote-location-runner) — needs only WS1's drafted wire-frame shapes, not a finished container.
3. WS3 (remote-tool-bridge) — depends on WS2's runner/session plumbing existing.
4. WS4 (agent-picker-ui) — can start in parallel with WS3 once WS2 exposes a manifest client + Location-binding call.
5. WS5 (compose-dev-env) — last, integrates all of the above for a working demo.

WS5's `VERIFY.md` should reference `test-requirements.md`'s three demo scripts (Demo 1 basic
path, Demo 2 + steer/stop, Demo 3 + participant targeting) directly rather than duplicating
their steps; author `VERIFY.md` as a short pointer plus environment-specific setup notes.

See `requirements.md` for Goal/Problem/Decisions/DoD, `design-proposal.md` for investigation,
root cause, and per-workstream resolution/change surfaces, and `test-requirements.md` for the
three demo scripts used to validate the DoD end-to-end.
